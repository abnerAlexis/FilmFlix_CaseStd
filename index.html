        <h2>Purpose and Context:</h2>
        <p>FilmFlix is a web application developed using the MERN stack as part of my training at CareerFoundry's
            full-stack immersion course. It serves as a showcase of my proficiency in full-stack JavaScript development.
        </p>

        <h2>Objective:</h2>
        <p>The primary objective of the project was to demonstrate my ability to develop a comprehensive full-stack web
            application. I aimed to showcase my skills in both front-end and back-end development using the MERN stack.
        </p>

        <h2>Credits:</h2>
        <p>This project was undertaken solely by me as the project lead and developer. While I received guidance from my
            tutors and mentors, all aspects of development were handled independently.</p>

        <h2>Duration:</h2>
        <p>The project spanned over 3 months, during which I completed server-side programming with Node.js and backend
            setup, followed by client-side programming with React.js for frontend development.</p>
