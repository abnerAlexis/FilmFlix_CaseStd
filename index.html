                    <h3>Step 2: Backend Setup (Node.js and Express.js)</h3>
                <h4>Why was this step important?</h4> 
                Setting up the backend was crucial for establishing the server-side logic and
                 API endpoints required for interaction with the frontend.<br>

                 <img class="icon" src="./img/purpose.png" alt="icon"/>
                 <h4>Purpose and Impact</h4> 
                The goal was to create a robust backend architecture that could handle data 
                processing and serve as the communication bridge between the frontend and the database. 
                This directly impacted the functionality and performance of the application. <br>

                <img class="icon" src="./img/tech.jpeg" alt="icon"/>
                <h4>Technologies and Skills Employed</h4>
                I utilized Node.js and Express.js for backend development, leveraging their asynchronous 
                nature and middleware capabilities. Skills required included server-side scripting and 
                API development.

                <img class="icon" src="./img/challenge.png" alt="icon"/>
                <h4>Challenges and how I solved them</h4>
                Optimizing database queries posed a challenge due to the complexity of data retrieval 
                operations. I addressed this by analyzing query execution plans and indexing strategies 
                to enhance query performance.<br>
            
                <img class="icon" src="./img/decision.png" alt="icon"/>
                <h4>Decisions Process</h4>
                As part of the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack and a requirement 
                within the course curriculum, the integration of Express.js was indispensable. 
                Recognizing its integral role in the stack and its significance within the course 
                guidelines, I opted to implement Express.js for building RESTful APIs. This decision 
                was driven not only by its inclusion in the MERN stack but also by its reputation for 
                simplicity and flexibility in API development. Moreover, leveraging Express.js 
                ensured alignment with course objectives and provided valuable hands-on experience 
                with a widely-used technology within the context of full-stack development.

            <p class="step4">
                <h3>Step 4: Database Setup with MongoDB</h3>
                <img id="mongo" src="./img/mongodb.png" alt="mongodb image" width="40%">
                <h4>Why was this step important?</h4> 
                Configuring the database with MongoDB was crucial for storing and managing application 
                data efficiently.<br>

                <img class="icon" src="./img/purpose.png" alt="icon"/>
                <h4> Purpose and Impact</h4>
                 The goal was to establish a scalable and flexible database architecture that could 
                accommodate the application's data requirements. This directly influenced data 
                management and retrieval processes within the application.<br>
                
                <img class="icon" src="./img/tech.jpeg" alt="icon"/>
                <h4>Technologies and Skills Employed</h4>
                For database setup, I utilized MongoDB, a NoSQL database, leveraging its 
                document-oriented structure and scalability features. Skills required included 
                database management, MongoDB query language, and understanding of data modeling 
                concepts.
